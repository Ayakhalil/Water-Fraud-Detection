# Water-Fraud-Detection
The main problem we are focusing on is detecting the suspected customers that
manipulate with their water meter readings, steal from other water pipes, or any
other fraud that might affect the meter reading by analyzing the prior meter
readings data from (Miyahuna) and building models based on that data, then
predicting the suspected frauds by pointing out the suspicious customers to the
water providers, so they can do their inspections on them.
As a result, we used four different supervised machine learning techniques such
as: logistic regression, random forests, support vector machine and k-nearest
neighbor by training the algorithms models with the data that we were given. We
can say that these models were efficient in resulting some customers with possible
frauds.
